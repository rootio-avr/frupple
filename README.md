# Frupple Library - Breaking Changes Detection Task

## Overview
This repository contains two versions of the `frupple` geometric computation library, designed as a practical exercise for to identify and understand different types of changes between software versions.

## Task Description
Your task is to analyze the differences between version 1.0.0, 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 of the frupple library and categorize the changes into:

1. **Breaking Changes** - Changes that would cause existing code to fail
2. **Non-breaking Changes** - Changes that add functionality or improve implementation without affecting existing APIs
3. **Internal Changes** - Changes that modify internal implementation but maintain the same external behavior


Good luck with your analysis!
